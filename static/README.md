How to style the website
------- 

Our main file to style the website is called style.less and lives at static/less/style.less

The compilation is done via server, so we serve only the css online and the user does not have to compile it.
All the info are here: https://github.com/mattions/ssouk_web/blob/master/scripts/README.md
